            <p class="hover-text">Milk chocolate is a solid chocolate confectionery containing cocoa, sugar and milk. It is the most consumed type of
            chocolate. Chocolate was originally sold and consumed as a beverage in pre-Columbian times. Although four-fifths of all
            milk chocolate is sold in the United States and Europe, increasingly large amounts are consumed in China and Latin
            America.</p>

            <p class="hover-text">Milk is a white liquid food produced by the mammary glands of mammals. It is the primary source of nutrition for young
            mammals (including breastfed human infants) before they are able to digest solid food.Early-lactation milk, which is
            called colostrum, contains antibodies that strengthen the immune system, and thus reduces the risk of many diseases.
            Milk contains many nutrients, including protein and lactose.</p>

              of fiber, healthy fats, and plant protein. Plus, they’re great on their own, paired with fruit, or added to dishes like

              <p class="hover-text">Semi-sweet chocolate has a cocoa solid content of 35 to 65%. One of the best ways to gain an understanding of this type
              of chocolate is to compare it to a different type of chocolate. Semisweet is darker than milk chocolate. In a taste
              comparison, it has a slightly bitter taste whereas milk chocolate is sweeter and more mellow. This delectable flavor of
              chocolate is very versatile.</p>
